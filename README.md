# 3D Models in React Native using React Three Fiber

This project showcases how to render and interact with 3D models in a React Native environment using React Three Fiber and Three.js. It features a drone and Starlink model that users can rotate, zoom in, and explore.

# Overview

In this project, I used React Native in combination with React Three Fiber to display 3D models within a mobile application. The models were imported as .glb files and converted to JSX using the GLTF JSX Converter, allowing for easy integration and manipulation.

The app includes orbit controls that enable users to explore the models from different angles interactively.

# Technologies Used

	•	React Native: For the mobile app development framework.
	•	Expo: To add support for WebGL and rendering 3D content.
	•	React Three Fiber: A React renderer for Three.js to manage 3D models.
	•	Three.js: The 3D engine for rendering models.
	•	@react-three/drei: A library of helpers, including useGLTF for easy loading of 3D models.
	•	r3f-native-orbitcontrols: Provides interactive camera controls to navigate the 3D models.

# Features

	•	Interactive 3D Models: Includes a drone and Starlink, with the ability to rotate and zoom.
	•	Orbit Controls: Users can manipulate the camera view around the models using familiar gestures.
	•	GLTF to JSX Conversion: The .glb model files were converted into React components for seamless integration.
	•	Model Adjustments: Various tweaks were made to enhance the model’s appearance and behavior, ensuring a smooth experience.

# How to Explore

Visit the repository, clone the project, and run it on your device to explore the 3D models. Feel free to modify and experiment with the models and the code for your own use cases!
